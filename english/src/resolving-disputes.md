# Resolving disputes

When a user initiates a dispute, a message is sent by the bot to the dispute channel. Only **solvers** can take it by tapping the **Take dispute** button.

Once the solver takes the dispute, the bot will send them all the necessary information to resolve it. The solver will also have to communicate with each party, understand what happened, and **complete** the order or **cancel it**.
