# How does the user reputation system work?

For every trade you make, you will be asked to rate your counterparty, while your counterparty will rate you. To do this, [**lnp2pBot**](https://t.me/lnp2pBot) has a 5-star rating system that will allow you to rate your experience, where 1 star is the lowest rating and 5 stars are the highest. 

When you create an offer, it will include by default the number of successful trades you have made and the ratings received from your counterparties.
