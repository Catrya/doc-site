# Communities

Responding to this issue, the communities enter the scene. Now users have much more freedom of maneuver, because they will be able to create and manage their communities to buy and sell sats, limiting these operations to the fiat currencies autonomously used in the region, but... "with great power comes great responsibility". This means that once users start working in their communities, they will also have to manage any disputes that occur.
