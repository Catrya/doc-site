# Communities

In response to this matter, communities come into the picture. Now users have much more freedom of maneuver, because they will be able to create and manage their own communities to buy and sell sats by limiting these operations to the fiat currencies used in the region in an autonomous way, but.... "with great power comes great responsibility". This means that as soon as users start working in their own communities they will also have to manage any disputes.
