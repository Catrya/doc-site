# Settle an order

Many disputes start because one of the two parties was slow to respond to a message, there was a misunderstanding, or payment was delayed. These are simple cases that only require patience and help in communication.
Other cases involve malice, for example, there may be a seller who wants to keep the fiat money and return the sats. For these cases, the solver can execute the `/settleorder` command, what this command does is that it recognizes the received payment and automatically sends the sats to the buyer.
