# How do I cancel a posted order?

If the order has not been taken, use the command `/cancel` in your chat with the bot or select it in the "Menu". The bot will show you the active orders. Select the ID corresponding to the order you want cancel.

The ID or identification number of your order appears just below the message of acceptance and publication, and it is even indicated to you as an option to cancel it. 

If the order has been taken, you must initiate a cooperative cancellation.
