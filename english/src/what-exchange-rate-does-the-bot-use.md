# What exchange rate does the bot use?

When creating an order you can choose to specify only the fiat amount to be `paid/charge`, but not the sats amount to `buy/sell`. In this case, you should select the "Market price" button, and then the bot will calculate at the market rate offered by [yadio.io](https://yadio.io/).
